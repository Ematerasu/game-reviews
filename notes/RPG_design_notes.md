# RPG Design Notes

> Living document – personal design framework for role-playing games
> Focus: systemic RPGs, not marketing labels

## 0. Purpose of This Document

**Why this exists:**

* To clarify what *RPG* means in a design sense
* To extract reusable lessons from existing games
* To avoid repeating known genre mistakes
* To guide future RPG system design decisions

**What this is NOT:**

* Not a review collection
* Not a nostalgia log
* Not a feature wishlist

---

## 1. Working Definition of an RPG

> **An RPG is a game in which the player consciously shapes a *functional role* through permanent *systemic and diegetic decisions*, and the game *consistently* and *symmetrically* responds to that role in its mechanics, world structure, and ways of interacting with it.**

### Key implications:

* Role ≠ character ≠ protagonist
* Decisions must be **persistent and costly**
* Systemic + narrative reactions are both required
* Player cannot be everything at once

### Exclusions by definition:

* Games with reversible or consequence-free builds
* Pure narrative choice games (e.g. visual novels)
* Progression-only games (stats ≠ role)

---

## 2. Core RPG Pillars (Design Axes)

These are the **non-negotiable axes** of RPG design.

### 2.1 Role Formation

How is the role formed?

* Classes
* Factions / guilds
* Ideology / morality
* Reputation / social standing
* Skill specialization
* Background / origin

**Design test:**

> Does choosing A permanently restrict access to B?

---

### 2.2 Systemic Reactivity

How does the game *respond* to the role?

* Quest availability
* Dialogue options
* Companion behavior
* Access to locations
* Combat solutions
* Economy and resources

**Red flag:**

> Different role, same gameplay.

---

### 2.3 Narrative Reactivity

How does the story adapt?

* Branching resolutions
* Companion alignment shifts
* Ideological consequences
* World state changes
* Epilogues (secondary, not primary)

**Important:**
Narrative reactivity without mechanical reactivity ≠ RPG.

---

### 2.4 Persistence & Cost

What does the player *lose* by choosing?

* Locked content
* Resource inefficiency
* Social rejection
* Mechanical penalties
* Narrative consequences

**Rule:**
If nothing is lost, no role was played.

---

## 3. Combat as Role Expression

Combat must reinforce role identity, not flatten it.

### 3.1 Class Gameplay Loops

Each class must have:

* A distinct **win condition**
* A unique **resource tension**
* A different **decision rhythm**

**Anti-pattern:**
All classes auto-attack while cooldowns tick.

---

### 3.2 Decision Density

* Early game: low density, teaching
* Mid game: expanding options
* Late game: **new decision types**, not bigger numbers

**Critical failure:**
Endgame = same loop, higher stats.

---

### 3.3 Scaling & Endgame

Questions to answer:

* Do builds *peak*, or *mature*?
* Are new tools introduced late-game?
* Does mastery change how the game is played?

---

## 4. Progression Philosophy

### 4.1 Vertical vs Horizontal Progression

* **Vertical:** power, access, capability
* **Horizontal:** options, flexibility

**Preferred balance:**

* Early: horizontal exploration
* Mid–late: vertical commitment

**Anti-pattern:**
Horizontal bloat without payoff (DAO skill trees).

---

### 4.2 Respec Policy

Ask explicitly:

* Is respec allowed?
* At what cost?
* What does respec *mean* narratively?

**Guideline:**
Unlimited free respec undermines role persistence, but there should be option for a player to change playstyle in the middle of a game once they learn more about possibilities.

---

## 5. Items, Economy, and Loot

### 5.1 Item Identity

Items should:

* Enable new tactics
* Reinforce roles
* Change decision-making

**Bad items:**
+3% damage, no behavioral impact.

---

### 5.2 Economy as a System

Gold should:

* Gate access
* Create tension
* Force prioritization

**Failure mode:**
Gold inflation with no meaningful sinks.

---

## 6. Companions as Systems

Companions are **not buffs with dialogue**.

### 6.1 Companion Reactivity

* Ideological disagreement
* Mechanical divergence
* Loyalty with consequences
* Possible departure or betrayal. Possible shaping.

**Gold standard:**
KOTOR 2 Influence system.

---

### 6.2 Companion Builds

Ask:

* Are companions pre-built?
* Can player meaningfully shape them?
* Do their mechanics reinforce their beliefs?

---

## 7. World Structure & Pacing

### 7.1 World Size vs Density

* Smaller world, higher consequence density > giant sandbox
* Access-based progression > scaling world

**Lesson:**
Gothic > Gothic 3.

---

### 7.2 Narrative Structure

* Chapters / acts as pacing tools
* Structural branching > cosmetic choices
* Missable content is a feature, not a flaw (Enhances replayability!)

---

## 8. Common RPG Anti-Patterns

* Open world checklists
* Binary morality meters
* Illusion of choice (One obvious choice if played normally)
* Cosmetic factions (only different armor)
* Late-game stagnation
* Respec abuse
* “You are the chosen one” without mechanical weight

---

## 9. Case Studies (Expandable)

### 9.1 Dragon Age: Origins

* Strong narrative
* Weak systemic scaling
* Flat late-game combat

### 9.2 KOTOR 2

* Ideological role-playing
* System–narrative coupling
* Kreia as systemic commentary

### 9.3 Gothic 2 / Chronicles of Myrtana

* Role enforced by world
* Access-based progression
* Controlled non-linearity

### 9.4 Baldur’s Gate 3

* High systemic reactivity
* Weak endgame scaling
* Encounter design issues in Act 3

---

## 10. Personal Design Principles (To Be Refined)

* World must say “no”
* Roles require sacrifice
* Systems must mature, not just scale
* Narrative must emerge from mechanics
* Comfort ≠ depth
* RPG ≠ power fantasy by default

---

## 11. Open Questions

* How much reactivity is enough?
* Can RTwP support BG3-level decision density?
* Is modern AAA compatible with true RPG constraints?
* How to design moral systems without meters?

---

### Final Note

> **If a system does not reinforce role persistence or world reactivity, it does not belong in an RPG.**
