## Game

(I try to make this spoiler-free, but there are some "clues" on some story parts. Had to point it out.)
---

## 1. High-Level Overview

> Dragon Age: Origins delivers strong narrative, worldbuilding, and long-term consequences, but its RPG systems feel underdeveloped, shallow, and structurally unbalanced, especially in the late game. The game succeeds as a narrative RPG but falls short as a deep systemic one.

---

## 2. Concrete Notes & Observations

### 2.1 What Works Well

- Strong worldbuilding and lore.
- Consistent dark-fantasy tone.
- Meaningful narrative consequences reflected in epilogues.
- Some companions are well-written and memorable (Alistair, Leliana, Morrigan).
- RTwP concept has solid foundations.
- Tactics system is conceptually interesting and forward-thinking.

---

### 2.2 Problems / Friction Points

- Companions join with ~60% of their builds already locked.
- No respec system limits player ownership over characters.
- Skill trees are shallow and effectively completed by level 9–10.
- Severe structural class imbalance (mages dominate).
- Warriors lack meaningful gameplay decisions.
- Active abilities are weak compared to auto-attacks. (Except for mage ofc, other classes have weak abilities)
- Stamina system discourages active skill usage. (Okay, I take it back, because it's problem of horizontal skill progress, too many skills, too little stamina, skills dont feel rewarding)
- Loot lacks identity and rarely affects playstyle.
- Many progression choices feel like taxes rather than expression.
- Companion relationships are binary and static.
- Economy is kinda boomed, I'm walking with 150 golds and I cannot spend that on anything valuable, I bought all potions from the shops and still have that much gold.

---

### 2.3 Systemic or Design Observations

- Mages are structurally overpowered due to access to CC, AoE, sustain, and scaling.
- Warriors lack a class-specific resource system, making tanking passive and unengaging.
- Rogues are viable only in narrow builds and require heavy setup.
- Classes lack distinct gameplay loops beyond mana/stamina.
- RTwP lacks planning tools (action queue, battlefield clarity).
- Tactics system does not scale to higher difficulties due to limited logic depth.
- Items are mostly numerical upgrades with no systemic impact.
- Replayability is driven by structural variation, not emotional divergence.

---

### 2.4 Memorable Moments / Highlights

- Redcliffe Castle questline as a standout moral dilemma + Morrigan proposal in the endgame.
- Key companion confrontations tied to major story decisions.
- Final act narrative resolutions and epilogues.
- In the endgame we had very good narrative choices which impact heavily gameplay (companions).

---

## 3. Core Evaluation Categories

### 3.1 Gameplay & Mechanics

- RTwP combat with limited planning support.
- Heavy reliance on auto-attacks.
- Low decision density during combat, especially in late game.
- Active abilities feel ornamental rather than core.
- Narrative may impact the gameplay (companions in/out in the endgame).

Notes:
- Gameplay lacks a strong late-game evolution.
- Combat depth does not scale with player progression.
- Pause is used reactively rather than strategically.
- I think it would be great addition for every major choice to add possibility to ask companions for advice, to get their view. In DA:O its not obvious what companions think about the choice, sometimes
my decisions get negative approval from some of them and I don't see valid reason why. (suddenly after writing this I started to get their opinions on some choices lol)

---

### 3.2 Systems & Design Coherence

- Narrative systems are strong and cohesive.
- Gameplay systems often fail to support the intended RPG fantasy.
- Class, item, and progression systems do not reinforce each other.

Notes:
- Strong narrative pillar, weak systemic pillar.
- Buildcraft, loot, and combat feel disconnected.

---

### 3.3 Presentation & Feel

- Strong atmosphere and tone.
- Functional, (well imo) dated visuals.
- Clear audio and music supporting narrative weight.

Notes:
- Presentation carries the experience more than systems.

---

### 3.4 Narrative / Theme / Atmosphere

- Dark fantasy tone maintained consistently.
- Worldbuilding is rich and believable.
- Companion writing is uneven but occasionally excellent.
- The fact that game is divided into "sections" with completely different and separate locations makes the playthrough easier and lighter
- Pacing is well kept

Notes:
- Narrative is the strongest aspect of the game.

---

### 3.5 UX / Accessibility

- Targeting and battlefield readability are poor, especially indoors.
- Camera limitations reduce tactical clarity.
- UI supports basic functionality but lacks strategic overview.
- UI is good enough, does its job.

Notes:
- 

---

### 3.6 Longevity & Replay Value

- Strong structural replayability (epilogues, alliances, outcomes).
- Weak system replayability.

Notes:
- Replay value is driven by content variation, not gameplay evolution.

---

## 4. Technical aspects

- Engine is solid (Aurora iirc)
- Had few crashes but for an old game it wasn't bad, it doesn't affect my scoring. (In the end I had quite a lot of crashes, most likely due to memory leaks or too many objects spawned from abilities.)
- Loads fast, textures load correctly in time (LOD is fine)

## 5. Evaluation & Scoring

**Gameplay & Mechanics:** 7 / 10  
**System Coherence:** 7 / 10  
**Presentation & Feel:** 9 / 10  
**Narrative / Atmosphere:** 9.5 / 10  
**UX / Accessibility:** 8 / 10  
**Longevity / Replayability:** 8 / 10

## 6. Final Evaluation

**Strengths:** 
* Story, non-linear, engaging
* Main characters

**Weaknesses:** 
* game balance
* lack of re-spec

**Final Verdict:**
This review might seem harsh, but I truly believe this is a really good game. I might not replay it soon, but maybe in a few years I'll try more "evil" and "heartless" approach to see some different outcomes. Is it one of the GOATs? Not really, I don't feel like it shaped the genre or changed anything. Although it's a shame to see what Dragon Age looked like and what it looks like now with the Veilguard slop.

**My ending**: \
Alistar is king with Anora as Queen. Loghain dead. Morrigan had child with Alistair and got archdemon's soul in it. My character lives and is hero of ferelden.

Urn of the sacred ashes: Protected by Leliana, Brother Genitivi returned to Denerim.

Circle of Magi: Templars ending, Circle not given independence

Redcliffe: Saved, Connor is dead

Dalish: Sided with Zathrian, the curse was ended.

Orzammar: Sided with Harrowmont, Branka lives and uses anvil.

Haven't romanced anyone because I'm a sigma and I dont enjoy romances in games B)

**Overall Score:** 8.5 / 10
