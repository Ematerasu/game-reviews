# Dragon Age: Origins

## Systemic & Design Review

> **High-level summary:**
> Dragon Age: Origins delivers strong narrative, worldbuilding, and consequences, but its RPG systems feel underdeveloped, shallow, and structurally unbalanced, especially in the late game.

---

## 1. Character Progression & Buildcraft

### 1.1 Companions Join in a “Broken” State

* Companions join the party with **~60% of their build already locked in**.
* No respec system means:

  * no player control over character concept,
  * no ownership over party composition,
  * reduced replayability.
* Example:

  * **Morrigan** joins with many low-impact or redundant spells.

**Impact:**

* Buildcraft is undermined.
* Systemic replayability suffers.
* Party members feel pre-authored rather than player-shaped.

---

### 1.2 Shallow Skill Trees & Early Build Completion

* Around **level 9-10**:

  * builds are effectively finished,
  * remaining progression is mostly filler.
* Most active skills:

  * are weaker than auto-attacks,
  * do not change gameplay patterns,
  * scale poorly into late game.
* Missing elements:

  * meaningful combos, (I'm aware of shattering for example but that's not enough + only for mages)
  * cross-tree synergies,
  * late-game build evolution.

---

## 2. Class Design & Balance

### 2.1 Structural Class Imbalance

* **Mages are structurally overpowered**, not numerically:

  * crowd control,
  * AoE,
  * sustain,
  * synergy stacking,
  * strong late-game scaling.
* **Warriors are the weakest class**, because:

  * no unique resource system, (like guard in Dragon Age Inquisition)
  * tanking = absorbing damage until death,
  * minimal gameplay decisions.
* **Rogues**:

  * viable only in specific builds,
  * require heavy setup to function.

---

### 2.2 Lack of Class-Specific Systems

* Classes lack distinct gameplay loops.
* Mana / stamina alone is insufficient.
* Missing:

  * resource generation vs expenditure,
  * risk–reward decisions,
  * moment-to-moment agency.

**Result:**

> Only mages meaningfully “play the system.”

---

## 3. Combat Systems (RTwP)

### 3.1 RTwP Without Planning Tools

* Missing:

  * free camera,
  * proper battlefield overview,
  * reliable targeting (especially indoors),
  * visible action timelines.
* No **action queue** system (unlike KotOR).

**Effect:**

> Pause loses strategic value and becomes tactical spam.

---

### 3.2 Stamina & Active Ability Problems

* Stamina regenerates too slowly.
* Sustained abilities permanently reduce the resource pool.
* Active skills compete with each other instead of forming rotations.

**Outcome:**

* Auto-attack spam dominates.
* Active abilities feel ornamental rather than core.
* Few meaningful tactical decisions.
* Lack of "late game" feeling

---

## 4. AI & Automation

### 4.1 Tactics System: Good Idea, Weak Execution

* Single-layer IF rules only.
* No:

  * AND / OR logic,
  * compound states,
  * prioritization layers.
* Works on Normal difficulty, but:

  * does not scale to higher difficulties,
  * cannot replace real planning or intent modeling.

Although I'm impressed by the idea and I see potential in this.

---

## 5. Items, Loot & Economy

### 5.1 Loot Inflation & Lack of Item Identity

* **90–99% of items are vendor trash.**
* Differences are mostly numeric, not functional.
* Gear lacks clear archetypes.

Examples:

* Gear replaced like 3-4 times during the game.
* Morrigan using the same staff for most of the game.
* Loot rarely alters playstyle.

---

### 5.2 Items Do Not Support Buildcraft

* Equipment:

  * does not change rotations,
  * does not affect decision-making,
  * does not unlock alternative strategies.
* Missing item archetypes:

  * CC-focused,
  * sustain-focused,
  * burst-oriented,
  * auto-attack synergies.

**Loot ≠ buildcraft.**

---

## 6. Character Progression Taxes

* Mandatory or near-mandatory investments:

  * Coercion,
  * Lockpicking (rogues)
* Some seem useless:
  * Herbalism (there's no problem with potions at all)
  * Poisons
  * Stealing
* Points are spent to:

  * make the game function,
  * not to express a build fantasy.

---

## 7. Narrative Systems & Moral Choice

### 7.1 Moral Decisions: Sparse & Uneven

* The game is known for “hard choices,” but:

  * there are relatively few,
  * many are low-impact.
* **Connor (Redcliffe)** is the standout example.
* Early game choices:

  * often inconsequential,
  * lack emotional cost.
* Decisions are:

  * isolated events,
  * not cumulative moral arcs.

---

### 7.2 Companions: Binary Outcomes Instead of Processes

* Losing companions is a strong concept.
* But:

  * conflicts are one-off,
  * no long-term escalation.
* Approval system:

  * binary,
  * punishes pragmatism,
  * lacks nuance (“I disagree, but I understand”).
  * CAN'T INFLUENCE COMPANIONS! (I miss you KotOR)

### 7.3 Companions are uneven
* Some of them are great:
  * Alistair
  * Lelianna
  * Morrigan
* Some are boring
  * Sten
  * Shela
  * Wynne (Could argue)

Additionally they are so stereotypical, like from a disney fairy tale.

---

## 8. Replayability

### 8.1 Structural vs Emotional Replayability

* Strong:

  * epilogues,
  * alliance permutations,
  * branching outcomes.
* Weak:

  * emotional variance between playthroughs,
  * uncomfortable or morally escalating moments.

Replayability becomes:

> “See different checkboxes,” not “feel different experiences.”
