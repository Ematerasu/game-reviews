## 1. High-Level Overview

> Dragon Age: Origins delivers strong narrative, worldbuilding, and long-term consequences, but its RPG systems feel underdeveloped, shallow, and structurally unbalanced, especially in the late game. The game succeeds as a narrative RPG but falls short as a deep systemic one.

---

## 2. Concrete Notes & Observations

### 2.1 What Works Well

- Strong worldbuilding and lore.
- Consistent dark-fantasy tone.
- Meaningful narrative consequences reflected in epilogues.
- Some companions are well-written and memorable (Alistair, Leliana, Morrigan).
- RTwP concept has solid foundations.
- Tactics system is conceptually interesting and forward-thinking.

---

### 2.2 Problems / Friction Points

- Companions join with ~60% of their builds already locked.
- No respec system limits player ownership over characters.
- Skill trees are shallow and effectively completed by level 9–10.
- Severe structural class imbalance (mages dominate).
- Warriors lack meaningful gameplay decisions.
- Active abilities are weak compared to auto-attacks.
- Stamina system discourages active skill usage.
- Loot lacks identity and rarely affects playstyle.
- Many progression choices feel like taxes rather than expression.
- Moral choices are sparse and unevenly distributed.
- Companion relationships are binary and static.

---

### 2.3 Systemic or Design Observations

- Mages are structurally overpowered due to access to CC, AoE, sustain, and scaling.
- Warriors lack a class-specific resource system, making tanking passive and unengaging.
- Rogues are viable only in narrow builds and require heavy setup.
- Classes lack distinct gameplay loops beyond mana/stamina.
- RTwP lacks planning tools (action queue, battlefield clarity).
- Tactics system does not scale to higher difficulties due to limited logic depth.
- Items are mostly numerical upgrades with no systemic impact.
- Replayability is driven by structural variation, not emotional divergence.

---

### 2.4 Memorable Moments / Highlights

- Redcliffe Castle questline as a standout moral dilemma.
- Key companion confrontations tied to major story decisions.
- Final act narrative resolutions and epilogues.

## 3. Core Evaluation Categories

### 3.1 Gameplay & Mechanics

- RTwP combat with limited planning support.
- Heavy reliance on auto-attacks.
- Low decision density during combat, especially in late game.
- Active abilities feel ornamental rather than core.

Notes:
- Gameplay lacks a strong late-game evolution.
- Combat depth does not scale with player progression.

---

### 3.2 Systems & Design Coherence

- Narrative systems are strong and cohesive.
- Gameplay systems often fail to support the intended RPG fantasy.
- Class, item, and progression systems do not reinforce each other.

Notes:
- Strong narrative pillar, weak systemic pillar.
- Buildcraft, loot, and combat feel disconnected.

---

### 3.3 Presentation & Feel

- Strong atmosphere and tone.
- Functional, (well imo) dated visuals.
- Clear audio and music supporting narrative weight.

Notes:
- Presentation carries the experience more than systems.

---

### 3.4 Narrative / Theme / Atmosphere

- Dark fantasy tone maintained consistently.
- Worldbuilding is rich and believable.
- Companion writing is uneven but occasionally excellent.

Notes:
- Narrative is the strongest aspect of the game.

---

### 3.5 UX / Accessibility

- Targeting and battlefield readability are poor, especially indoors.
- Camera limitations reduce tactical clarity.
- UI supports basic functionality but lacks strategic overview.

Notes:
- Pause is used reactively rather than strategically.

---

### 3.6 Longevity & Replay Value

- Strong structural replayability (epilogues, alliances, outcomes).
- Weak emotional replayability.

Notes:
- Replay value is driven by content variation, not gameplay evolution.
